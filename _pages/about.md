Welcome to my blog!


I am Lorenzo a passionated data scientist always looking for new stimulus and problems to solve in an elegant way. I graduated from Universit√† degli studi di Padova with a master's degree in Mathematical Engineering. 

Before leaving us the great physicist Richard Feynman wrote on the blackboard: "Know how to solve every problem that has been solved", I want to follow this advice because ideas come to people ready to catch them, only being prepared can lead you to see a world behind an equation written down on a piece of paper.
